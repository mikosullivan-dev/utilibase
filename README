Utilibase version 0.0.2
May 27, 2017

Utilibase is an ACID compliant NoSQL database system.
See the wiki for more details: https://github.com/mikosullivan/utilibase/wiki/Utilibase

This is a very early release of Utilibase. This release tests the methods in
testmin.rb. Utilibase is not yet a working database system. Right now we need
testers. Testing is very simple. See the "Testing" section below for
instructions on how to test Utilibase.


Prerequisites

Utilibase is designed for Unix derivative systems such as Linux and BSD. To run
on those systems you'll need the following software installed:

- Ruby
- SQLite3
- the Ruby gem for SQLite3


Testing

To run the tests, change into the "tests" directory. Run ./testmin.rb. The tests
should run and you should be asked if the script may submit the results to our
testing service.
