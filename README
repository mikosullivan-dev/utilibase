Utilibase version 0.0.1
May 19, 2017

This is a very early release of Utilibase. This release is more about testing
the testmin.rb script than testing Utilibase itself.

To run the tests, download an unzip this project. Change into the tests
directory. Run ./testmin.rb. The tests should run and you should be prompted
about submitting the results.
