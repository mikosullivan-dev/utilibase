Utilibase version 0.0.1
May 19, 2017

This is a very early release of Utilibase. This release is more about testing
the testmin.rb script than testing Utilibase itself.

Prerequisites

Utilibase is designed for Unix derivative systems such as Linux and BSD. To run
on those systems you'll need the following software installed:

- Ruby
- SQLite3
- the ruby gem for SQLite3

Install

Testing

To run the tests, download change into the tests directory. Run ./testmin.rb.
The tests should run and you should be prompted about submitting the results.
