Utilibase version 0.0.1
May 26, 2017

Utilibase is an ACID compliant NoSQL database system. It is written in Ruby and
uses SQLite3.

This is a very early release of Utilibase. This release is more about testing
the testmin.rb script than testing Utilibase itself.

Prerequisites

Utilibase is designed for Unix derivative systems such as Linux and BSD. To run
on those systems you'll need the following software installed:

- Ruby
- SQLite3
- the Ruby gem for SQLite3

Testing

To run the tests, change into the "tests" directory. Run ./testmin.rb. The tests
should run and you should be prompted about submitting the results.

How you can help

The help that is needed right now is testing. Run these tests on as many
different types of systems as you can, then submit the results.

One of the issues we need to nail down is what are the best minimum versions of
Ruby, SQLite3 and the SQLite3 gem. Your input on that issue would be
appreciated.

Contact

Please feel free to contact me about Utilibase. I'm very excited about this
project and want to spread the word.
